# GaiaShield - AI-Powered Resilience Platform
## GEF2025 Hackathon Submission

### 🎯 Executive Summary

**GaiaShield** is an AI-powered resilience platform that protects entrepreneurs and SMEs from the three greatest threats of our time: **climate disruption, business volatility, and cyber attacks**.

By combining Google Gemini AI with real-time data analysis, GaiaShield provides actionable intelligence that helps businesses survive and thrive in an uncertain world.

## 🌍 The Problem

Entrepreneurs worldwide face unprecedented challenges:

- **Climate Crisis**: 60% of SMEs lack climate risk assessment tools
- **Business Uncertainty**: 82% of startups fail due to cash flow issues
- **Cyber Threats**: SMEs experience 43% of all cyber attacks but only 14% are prepared

**The gap**: Existing solutions are expensive, fragmented, and inaccessible to most entrepreneurs, especially in developing regions.

- **Sector-specific risk assessment** (agriculture, retail, logistics, etc.)
- **Predictive recommendations** with estimated cost savings
- **Use case**: A farmer in Kenya receives alerts 10 days before drought, saving $2,500 in crop losses

### 2. 💼 Business Shield
- **Financial health analysis** from sales, inventory, and supplier data
- **Cash flow predictions** and resilience scoring (0-100)
- **Operational optimization** recommendations
- **Use case**: A SaaS startup identifies 83% revenue decline early, implements corrective actions worth $1M+

### 3. 🛡️ Cyber Protect

- **Real-time event classification** (safe/suspicious/malicious)
- **Automated response actions** (block, quarantine, alert)
- **Use case**: Healthcare platform blocks 3 malicious events, protecting patient data and HIPAA compliance
